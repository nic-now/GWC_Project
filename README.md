First tips:
- Can use any IDE/terminal/methods if you're familiar with github/remote repos, I prefer VSCode as my main IDE and to clone repos.
- Main actions:
  1. Clone repo
  2. Edit project
  3. Add/commit changes to local repo (git add __files_to_commit_, git commit - m "message")
  4. Push changes to this remote repo. (git push)
